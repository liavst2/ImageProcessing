Answer to Q2:
============

The bigger the gaussian filter, the better the blending is in
the environment. The effect is noticed only along the edges of
the mask, so other parts of both images remain the same.
For bigger filter, we have less high frequencies remaining so
we get spreader combination of the pixels. Thus the edges of
the mask are more difficult to identify (As you'll see in
my blending_example1)
