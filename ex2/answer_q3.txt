Answer for Q3:
-------------

We can vividly observe the black frame around the
output image of blur_spatial (the convolution blur),
while blur_fourier return an unframed image. This is
because of the "same" argument we add in convolve2d,
which, by its definition, returns only the central
part of the convolution.
